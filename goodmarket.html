		<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Good Market  wants expand their customer base and market share. They want to design and release a pilot program in Philadelphia, iterate based on what they learn and then expand the product to other cities around the country.</p></div>
	
		<div class="item1">
<p><strong>The Process</strong></p>
		<p> I started the process with competitive anylasis, card sorting and with started laying out a site map. I then focused on how the mobile app would function and created several user flows such as creating accounts and purchasing.</p>
</div>
		
		<div class="item1">
		<p><strong>The Outcome</strong></p>
<p>The mobile app design, when user-tested, score very high in usability. The most common response was that it was simple to navigate, and the purchasing process and shopping cart was was easy understand. Steps are now being made for development.</p>
